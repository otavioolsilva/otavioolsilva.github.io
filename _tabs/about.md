Hi! My name is Otávio and this is my personal blog where I expect to keep track of some experiences while studying. I'm an undergraduate student in Computer Science at USP (University of São Paulo).

At this moment, this space will be used specially to share some of my experiences while contributing to some Open Source projects, such as the Kernel Linux and the Kernel Workflow tool. It's been amazing learning how to contribute to the FLOSS world and I hope to be able to share my enthusiasm.

:)
