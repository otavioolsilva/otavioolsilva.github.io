Hi! My name is Otávio and this is my personal blog where I write about experiences while studying, to share and document them. I'm an undergraduate student in Computer Science at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics from the University of São Paulo (IME - USP), now in my 7th semester (2025/1).

I'm currently interested in the fields of computer networks and security, working on a scientific initiation project that also explores machine learning and Internet of Things. I also contribute to some open source projects, mainly in the GNOME ecosystem.

I hope to be able to share my enthusiasm. :)
