Hi! My name is Otávio and this is my personal blog where I expect to keep track of some experiences while studying. I'm an undergraduate student in Computer Science at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics from the University of São Paulo (IME - USP), now in my 6th semester.

I'm currently interested in the areas of computer networks and security, working on a scientific initiation project that also includes studies of machine learning and Internet of Things. I also contribute to some open source projects, mainly in the GNOME application collection.

I hope to be able to share my enthusiasm. :)
