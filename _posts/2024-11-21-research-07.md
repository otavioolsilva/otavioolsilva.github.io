During these last weeks, I kept testing the Raspberry Pi to verify its performance as I started in the [last post](https://otavioolsilva.github.io/posts/research-06/), but this time conducting experiments with the python libraries cited in [post 04](https://otavioolsilva.github.io/posts/research-04/), which are capable of sniffing the network traffic and manipulating this data. Here, I report the results and bring a brief discussion about them, I think it will be useful to revisit all of these findings to explore them in more depth!

## Tests

The tests were conducted using the scripts available [here](https://github.com/otavioolsilva/ddos-detection-iot-SI/tree/main/studies-and-tests/sniff-tests), which implements network traffic sniffers using the [Pyshark](https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark), [Scapy](https://scapy.net/) and [Pypcap](https://github.com/pynetwork/pypcap) python libraries, this last one being also accompanied with the [dpkt](https://github.com/kbandla/dpkt) library, which is capable of extracting information from the packets. The test flow is very simple, aimed to measure the Raspberry Pi performance dealing with live traffic using these different libraries:

- Run the python script and wait 10 seconds;
- Start an transmission of packets in the network to simulate live traffic during 10 seconds;
- After the artificial traffic finished, wait more 30 seconds and end the test, collecting the results[^footnote].

[^footnote]: The pypcap library doesn't implement a timeout mechanism that stops its execution after a given amount of time, so after the last 30 seconds (plus 2 seconds to have a safety margin) I do a simple ping to the server to generate a packet that will be out of the window of time defined manually in the code, so the loop breaks when the sniffer catches it.

All of the flow above is implemented in the [bash script](https://github.com/otavioolsilva/ddos-detection-iot-SI/blob/main/studies-and-tests/sniff-tests/sniff-run.sh) available in the repository cited before. Each of the tests were conducted five times with the same environment and the metrics exhibited below were based on these executions, usually taking the mean value of the numbers observed. To register each metric, I used:

- To measure the CPU use, the [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) python library, that is capable to retrieve informations about the system performance, like the percentage of CPU used by a process. Its operation is similar to the `ps` command in Linux: the `cpu_percent` method returns a float representing the CPU utilization as a percentage for a process since its last call using the total CPU time consumed, so this value can be bigger than 100.0 if the process is running multiple threads in different cores.

- To measure the memory use, the `resource` python module, which is capable of measuring the maximum resident set size used by the process in KBytes, in the same way described in the [last post](https://otavioolsilva.github.io/posts/research-06/#testing-the-baseline-models-on-a-raspberry-pi).

- The "number of packets counted" is an information calculated by the python scripts: their job is to count how many network traffic packets were sniffed and how many of them are TCP packets. This last information was collected only to perform a minimal packet parsing, using the libraries also to extract some content of the data, not being reported below as it doesn't aggregate much information.

- The "iperf3 flow data" field reports the parameters for the transmission of packets used by the [iperf3](https://iperf.fr/) app, which is the one used to simulate live traffic. More information about its use below.

- For the "total time", the `time` command, just to be sure that the workflow defined above was being followed.

As commented above, the application used to generate network traffic is [iperf3](https://iperf.fr/), which is a tool that can transmit packets in the client-server model allowing adjusting of many parameters. The scenarios executed were:

- Transmission of TCP packets in the localhost, with the Raspberry being the client and the server at the same time;
- Transmission of UDP packets at the bitrate of 1Mb/sec, 2Mb/sec, 3Mb/sec, 4Mb/sec, 5Mb/sec and 10Mb/sec in the localhost;
- Transmission of UDP packets without bitrate limit defined in the localhost;
- All the scenarios above but with the Raspberry being a client and my personal notebook being the server, on a private network without internet access. 

The machines specs used in the tests are:

- Raspberry Pi Model 3 B
    * Quad Core 1.2GHz Broadcom BCM2837 64bit CPU
    * 1GB RAM
    * Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) OS
    * 100 Mbit/s network interface card (Fast Ethernet)

- Acer Aspire 3 A315-41-R4RB
    * AMD Ryzen 5 2500U 2.0GHz 64bit CPU
    * 12GB DDR4 2667 MHz RAM
    * Fedora Linux 41 (Silverblue) OS
    * 1000 Mbits/s network interface card (Gigabit Ethernet)

For each of the tests described above, I tested the tree libraries cited, the results of each one are reported below.

The first thing to notice above is the intense use of CPU, that were a way greater than any of the other Python libraries. And this intensive use wasn't converted in better results: in the localhost scenario, we see that the library starts to struggle with 10 Mbits of bitrate, not taking in account all of the packets and its even worse with the remote server, failing already with 2 Mbits of bitrate. This give us some hints: the library is not suited to handle big volumes of traffic data, performing a little better with a smaller volume of bigger packets (as in the localhost scenario). However, its also worth to notice that apparently it also keeps a buffer of the unprocessed packets, as the data keeps being processed after the live flow ended, however the time given wasn't sufficient to handle of the traffic.

The CPU performance is a way more controlled and its number of packets count had an improvement in comparision to the last library: it starts to fail when using 4Mb/sec in the remote server scenario, still losing a lot of packets.

And finally, our best observations: the library apparently is capable of hadling big volumes of traffic without low consume of CPU time, even without bitrate limit in the remote server scenario, with a few packets lost. Notice also that its use of memory is constant independently of the volume of data and below the another libraries.

## Next steps

As defined in the [post 05](https://otavioolsilva.github.io/posts/research-05/#considerations-about-the-network-structure), our current goals are these:

- [ ] Packet Parsing
	- [ ] Conduct experiments to verify the performance of Python libraries sniffing the network and processing the packages in a Raspberry Pi (different from what we did in [post 4](https://otavioolsilva.github.io/posts/research-04/), in which we tested the lib's with the CIC-IoT-2023 dataset and in a regular computer).
- [ ] Inference
	- [X] Run the baseline models proposed in [post 02](https://otavioolsilva.github.io/posts/research-02/) in a Raspberry Pi to verify its performance.
- [ ] Training (centralized IDS)
	- TBD.

I still want to revisit all the data reported in this current post to make more deeper analysis and also to perform more experiments, specially considering a DDoS attack scenario to see how the libraries will perform, so the packet parsing topic will still require some work :).
